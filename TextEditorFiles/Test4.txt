this demonstrate adding more to the file.
wether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
Or take arms against a sea of troubles.
And by opposing end them.
To die
To sleep
And by a sleep we may say we end the thousand shocks and natural heartaches the body is heir to.
to die to sleep
aye theres the rub
for what dreams may visit us when we have shuffled of this mortal coil must give us pause.
