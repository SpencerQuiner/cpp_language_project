# Overview

This project is writen as a means to gain a basic understanding of the C++ programing language and to see if I could write a functional program using it in the two weeks
allowed for this project. This helps me become accustom to working with a deadline, which includes managing how much time I spent learning C++ and how much time I spent actually working on the project

The program I wrote is a very basic text editor. it includes the ability to create new files, edit existing files, and delete files. All the files are stored in a central directory and i was not able to code in the ability to specify where to save the file.

the purpose of writing this program was to try out the C++ programing language and see if I could create a program in the language given limited time to do it in. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I worked in the Visual Studio Code IDE with MinGW Gnu Compiler collection.

The program is written in C++ with the iostream, string, fstream, vector, and filesystem libraries.

# Future Work

Things I would improve or add.

- A GUI to run the program in.
- The ability to do more than just append text to the end of the file. To actually be able to edit the file contents. 
- the ability to save the file and continue editing like a normal word processor.
